A simple yet powerful Telegram bot for sending and receiving anonymous messages. Users can generate a personal link, share it, and receive anonymous feedback, questions, or messages from anyone.

## Features

- **Anonymous Messaging**: Send and receive messages without revealing your identity.
- **Personal Link**: Generate a unique link (`t.me/YourBot?start=<YourUserID>`) for others to send you messages.
- **Rich Media Support**: Supports text, photos, videos, voice messages, and video notes (video circles).
- **Anonymous Replies**: Recipients can anonymously reply to any message they receive.
- **Admin Controls**: A designated admin can block and unblock users from using the bot.
- **Suggestion Box**: Users can send ideas and suggestions directly to the bot admin.
- **Free & Ad-Free**: No costs or advertisements.

## How to Use

1.  **Start the Bot**: Send the `/start` command to the bot. It will reply with your unique personal link.
2.  **Share Your Link**: Copy this link and share it on your social media, profile, or directly with friends.
3.  **Receive Messages**: When someone clicks your link, they will be prompted to send you a message through the bot. The message will be forwarded to you anonymously.
4.  **Reply Anonymously**: Each anonymous message you receive comes with a "Reply" button, allowing you to respond without revealing your identity.
